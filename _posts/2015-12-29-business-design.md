**Business Design**

Contemporary companies need to think globally and holistically. Whenever a company designs new products or services, it is important that the entire business environment is included in the designing process. When these procedures are used correctly, the entire organization is inspired and customers are excited about a company. MaxMORIX combines business strategies and design thinking to support its customers to identify market niches and therefore reach an effective market growth.

Human Centred Design (HCD)

Human Centred Design (HCD) describes the activities of MaxMORIX. At the beginning of the process are focused the people for whom a product or service is designed. The end result is a state-of-the-art solution that is aligned to the needs of the target audiences. 

HCD consists of four elements:

* Preference
* Feasibility
* Affordability
* Cultural and Social Precondition

HDC opens the "black box" and makes room for new ideas. It's good to know that innovative products and ideas are not created while sitting isolated in front of a computer screen. If you want to know what your customer  "want" and what their expectations are, you must "mingling with the crowd".

Design is team work. MayMORIX has the necessary expertise and is able to form appropriate teams to create, together with you as a customer THE RIGHT SOLOTION for your consumers or users .
