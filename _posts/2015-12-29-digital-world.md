Digital World

Continious communication and learning is of great importance for all levels of our society. Social, cultural and economical factors must be integrated into our overall communication behaviour. No generation in human history had such a multitude of opportunities to gain knowledge in seconds and to spread their opinion in a variety of channels, as this is the case today.

Therefore we need to integrate communications into a holistic process. Since the entire development is mainly based on digital communications, all communication activities must take this into account.
